Really only major complaint is our server kept forgetting us (gave us water and then took 25 minutes to come back for our order and then didn't return until 45 minutes after we got our food....). Forgetting us is not a big deal, we were the only table outside and brunch is busy so it's an easy and understandable oversight. What made it weird and a 2/5 experience is that he acted like it was totally normal.... no acknowledgment that our plates and water glasses were bone dry and we had clearly been sitting for some time... no acknowledgment had he forgot us (twice). Just an exceptionally long wait compounded by how weird it was to not acknowledge the oversight left a bad aftertaste.... but will totally go back and try our luck with another server (or the same guy on a different day, shit happens)!

I was enticed by quite a few things on the menu, and I pondered them over while I sipped on the Bloody Mary I ordered to start. It was a good bloody mary. It wasnt the best I have had, simply because it needed more fresh horseradish and seasoning in my opinion, but it was a pretty good flavor profile. In true fashion of my family, we ordered a ton of appetizers for the table before ordering our own portions for brunch including the brussels sprouts with burratta, the smoked wings with chipotle glaze, and the Rhode Island calamari. We all ordered our own food, for me the huevos rancheros with red and green salsas, black beans and fried eggs and a side of scrapple. Everything we had was very well executed. The brussels sprouts with burratta was amazing. The creamy nature of the burratta with the charred edges of the brussels sprouts were fantastic. The wings were probably my least favorite. They werent quite crispy enough for me, just missing a bit of texture to make them that much better. The flavor of the sauce was great though. I am always a sucker for calamari and this was a great riff on it. It was fried crispy and had great vinegar taste to it. \n",

The beer list, both draft and bottle/can, was very extensive. We enjoyed some great, local craft beers. After sitting there for about half an hour, I walked over to the hostess to find out when we would get our table. She pointed out a nice, private booth and told me that that was our table. The diners there were just finishing up dessert and should be done soon. I figured, okay, shouldn't be long then. Well it was another 30 minutes and we were still sitting at the bar. I asked again and she said that they were just about to get us, they had another table.

The Bloody Beet salad was delicious. The Scallops entree was overpriced. While the scallops were cooked to perfection, big and juicy, the accompanying sides were scarce. For $28 I would have expected a bit more than a smattering of puree and a few slices of cooked carrots. The Colonial burger (beef and pork belly) was very tasty although for having pork belly in it - very dry (it had a pink center so it wasn't ordered overcooked). The fries were so good. All in all, I feel that the prices are just too high for what you're getting and for where you are. The prices reflect those that you would find in their fine dining restaurant in Philly.

My son's birthday was this weekend and he originally wanted to go to the Old Homestead at the Borgata but we wanted to take a ride so we showed him the menu for this spot and he agreed to give it a try.  He was not disappointed.  We entered the establishment for an early dinner and it was hopping.  I was really surprised to see so many people in there at 5:00 on a Saturday night but the bar was full and there were only a few empty tables.  We were seated in the dining room away from the bar which was good because my eyes would have been glued to the Alabama vs Florida game that was on.  We ordered drinks and 2 appetizers to start, the BeDeviled Eggs and the Tavern Pretzel.  The BeDeviled Eggs came in two varieties, Green Olive and Pork Belly with one of each egg soaked in beet juice to make the egg red.  The eggs were cooked and peeled properly with a smooth and mildly spicy filling topped with the previously mentioned offerings.  I preferred the brininess of the green olive example although the earthy saltiness of the pork belly was a nice contrast to the spicy filling.  A well executed and fun dish and a real bargain at only $5.  The pretzel came with three \"sides\" a smooth and sharp mustard, sriracha cheese dipping sauce and a sweet and smoky bacon onion jam.  The pretzel was warm and crusty and very unlike the soft pretzels you might get on the boardwalks of Jersey.  I feel that the sriracha cheese sauce lacked punch but it was still tasty and not a huge disappointment.  The mustard was, well, mustard.  I would have liked to see something of the stone ground variety but I still enjoyed it.  The real standout was the bacon onion jam.

The burgers were both amazing.  We asked for them to be cooked medium and this kitchen really knows what that means.  My 9 year old that ordered the Industrial Burger, which is made with dry aged brisket, said he thought his was cooked rare. I explained that it was a true medium and most of the time that he requests a medium burger he receives it somewhere between medium and medium well.  These were done properly.  The Industrial is fantastic.  The brisket is rich and happily fatty and flavorful and is topped with a proper cheddar cheese, \"tavern sauce\" and more of that wonderful onion jam that came with the pretzel.  A masterpiece of a burger.  The Colonial Burger is also great but walks a step behind the Industrial.  It is made with grass fed beef and it shows.  The thick cut bacon is amazing and plentiful as is the cheddar cheese and they made a great choice in topping this burger with a malt mayo.  My wife chose the Cauliflower Panini, mostly based on the fact that it's topped with ricotta salata.  I took a bit or two or three and I really enjoyed it.

Two dinners and one lunch in the last 4 weeks reinforced my initial review on the Fusili with Lobster dinner I had on the first visit. For lunch, brisket burger and half chopped salad. The burger was the tastiest most mouthwatering burger I've ever had. There were no condiments on the patty except a bit of cheese, and it certainly did not need any condiments. All the flavor was in the ground brisket and bun. Phenomenal. For dinner, rigatoni with short rib bolognese. Outstanding. Perfectly cooked pasta, lean short rib in semi blush tomato sauce.

The pizza could have been delicious but It had some type of very spicy pickled peppers or something on it that made it way to spicy to eat. I tried taking them off and it was still too spicy to eat and I like spicy.  I should have looked on the menu to see the ingredients but the take out girl said she could help me order so I didn't. She did mention the sausage on it but not the pickled spicy peppers or whatever it was that made it so incredibly spicy. I had to throw it out. The gentleman suggested the dessert pie and dessert kitchen sink when I got there. The dessert kitchen sink was dried out and not flavorful except for a strong coffee flavor, I expected more since there was so much in it. The pie was a cute idea but it was just ok in taste. \n",

I'm going to start by saying that I've been to Dolsot House once before and it is by no means a terrible Korean joint but it isn't the best either. Mediocre at best. It's a so-so restaurant with some pretty friendly waiters. My beef with this place is: 1) They need to hire some more waiters because the service is a bit slow 2) I ordered LA Kalbi dolsot where the whole entire entree was burnt (I posted a picture). The Kalbi was charred a little too much and the rice on the bottom was so burnt that by the time I had the chance to stir everything together, I could literally lift the whole entire bottom of the rice. I tried to salvage what I could but ultimately the dish left a horrible burnt after taste in my mouth that I decided not to finish it. I may come back just because I like to give small businesses the benefit of the doubt, but I will probably not be back for a while in hopes that the burnt after taste in my mouth is gone by then.', 'date': 1440951298000, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0}, {'review_id': 'NTJcaAtwldds2CF0-fEMRw', 'stars': 2, 'text': 'I've been here with a few friends almost every sunday for the last couple of months.

She bitched slightly about the Bass being \"downstairs,\" so being the understanding person I am, I went with a $5 pitcher of Miller Lite and asked for a food menu.

Don't worry, they said, we'll make mussels in the clam sauce (as if that is the same thing to a Rats diner!). When my wife went back out after her lobster, there was a small revolt in progress. The hostess never visited any of the disgruntled tables to try to make things right in any way. The server, who looked to be a high-school or college student (Rats used to have professional waitstaff) cleared the plates rapidly but never refilled water glasses or asked if we wanted refills on our drinks. Other dishes (including a blueberry cobbler) were not refilled either, causing diners to rush their meals for fear of not getting to try the dishes.

The lamb stew, made with lots of veggies and herbs was also a treat. The brussel sprouts with butternut squash in butter along with the dreamiest whipped potatoes  (pommes puree) were amazing. Their complimentary assortment of breads and artisan butter were great. During the meal they bring you this strange pastry called a \"pop over\". Buttery chewy crunchy goodness.

Maybe their ice cream is good? I tried their complicated stuff and was disappointed and tried keeping it simple to the same result. Generally, utterly flavorless. NaCl people. Use it. Drown this food in ketchup. Try something, anything. I could close my eyes and never know what I was eating. Bacon, pancake, fries, burger, chicken. Eyes shut, all the same taste. Best pancakes? For filling a pothole? As a manhole cover? They have the same texture as wet drywall-no exaggeration.  I had them twice and they were the same each time-I was hoping it was a horrible mistake. 3 pancakes weighed easily a pound and a half. No discernible bubbles inside at all. A travesty.  The syrup is brown sugar water and equally tasteless. Whatever gives the award for \"Best Pancakes\" to a place that cannot understand that maple syrup is what is served on pancakes should have their award giving status revoked.  If it was even supposed to have artificial maple flavor it did not. I had a bacon cheeseburger. I separated it into it's components. The bacon and the beef, tasted separately had essentially the same flavor and varied only in texture. Both kind of tasted like the bun except that was softer. How do you get bacon that is not salty enough? It usually competes with pork for the main ingredient. Fries came either limp or overdone. I tried their version of a fat sandwich and it was the same deal. Five or 6 ingredients and it may as well have had one since they all tasted like nothing. I added salt to everything it was appropriate to and it upgraded it from \"lump\" to \"food\". Best I could do. I consider ketchup to be something you drown food in if you are in a hurry and just need to get calories down, and that's what I did here. The pancakes are inedible.

We both got different kind of burgers, I built my own and he got the Cowboy Burger. Both were delicious! I love that I was able to build a burger to my taste and add a generous portion of (Maryland/Old Bay Spice) fries for a reasonable price. I do however wish I was asked how I'd like my burger cooked, as I do like my burgers a little bit on the pinker side, the one I received was VERY well done. My complaint lies in the service, although our waitress was sweet, I did feel quite hurried, which was surprising as the restaurant was empty. She approached us to take our drink order before I could even slip into the booth and take off my coat, I was caught off guard and asked what they had available, she pointed to the good ol' soda standard selection. It wasn't until I had already ordered my meal that I found out that I could have created my own flavored egg-cream soda pop, so I was immediately resentful at my plain Coca Cola.

I was enticed by quite a few things on the menu, and I pondered them over while I sipped on the Bloody Mary I ordered to start. It was a good bloody mary. It wasnt the best I have had, simply because it needed more fresh horseradish and seasoning in my opinion, but it was a pretty good flavor profile. In true fashion of my family, we ordered a ton of appetizers for the table before ordering our own portions for brunch including the brussels sprouts with burratta, the smoked wings with chipotle glaze, and the Rhode Island calamari. We all ordered our own food, for me the huevos rancheros with red and green salsas, black beans and fried eggs and a side of scrapple. Everything we had was very well executed. The brussels sprouts with burratta was amazing. The creamy nature of the burratta with the charred edges of the brussels sprouts were fantastic. The wings were probably my least favorite. They werent quite crispy enough for me, just missing a bit of texture to make them that much better. The flavor of the sauce was great though. I am always a sucker for calamari and this was a great riff on it. It was fried crispy and had great vinegar taste to it. \n",

We arrived 20 minutes early and proceeded to the bar where there were, thankfully, two seats left. The wine list is phenomenal with most wines on the list from Moore Brothers Wine Company. The beer list, both draft and bottle/can, was very extensive. We enjoyed some great, local craft beers. After sitting there for about half an hour, I walked over to the hostess to find out when we would get our table. She pointed out a nice, private booth and told me that that was our table. The diners there were just finishing up dessert and should be done soon. I figured, okay, shouldn't be long then. Well it was another 30 minutes and we were still sitting at the bar. I asked again and she said that they were just about to get us, they had another table. Well the table we ended up getting was much less impressive (i.e. private) but it was a table so we headed over.

The Bloody Beet salad was delicious. The Scallops entree was overpriced. While the scallops were cooked to perfection, big and juicy, the accompanying sides were scarce. For $28 I would have expected a bit more than a smattering of puree and a few slices of cooked carrots. The Colonial burger (beef and pork belly) was very tasty although for having pork belly in it - very dry (it had a pink center so it wasn't ordered overcooked). The fries were so good. All in all, I feel that the prices are just too high for what you're getting and for where you are. The prices reflect those that you would find in their fine dining restaurant in Philly.

My son's birthday was this weekend and he originally wanted to go to the Old Homestead at the Borgata but we wanted to take a ride so we showed him the menu for this spot and he agreed to give it a try.  He was not disappointed.  We entered the establishment for an early dinner and it was hopping.  I was really surprised to see so many people in there at 5:00 on a Saturday night but the bar was full and there were only a few empty tables.  We were seated in the dining room away from the bar which was good because my eyes would have been glued to the Alabama vs Florida game that was on.  We ordered drinks and 2 appetizers to start, the BeDeviled Eggs and the Tavern Pretzel.  The BeDeviled Eggs came in two varieties, Green Olive and Pork Belly with one of each egg soaked in beet juice to make the egg red.  The eggs were cooked and peeled properly with a smooth and mildly spicy filling topped with the previously mentioned offerings.  I preferred the brininess of the green olive example although the earthy saltiness of the pork belly was a nice contrast to the spicy filling.  A well executed and fun dish and a real bargain at only $5.  The pretzel came with three \"sides\" a smooth and sharp mustard, sriracha cheese dipping sauce and a sweet and smoky bacon onion jam.  The pretzel was warm and crusty and very unlike the soft pretzels you might get on the boardwalks of Jersey.  I feel that the sriracha cheese sauce lacked punch but it was still tasty and not a huge disappointment.  The mustard was, well, mustard.  I would have liked to see something of the stone ground variety but I still enjoyed it.  The real standout was the bacon onion jam.  It was sweet and slightly tangy with a smokey bacon saltiness cutting through the sweetness.  It is a perfect topping for this pretzel. \n",

The fish was fresh and the batter was light and crispy.  It was just a hair greasy.  Nothing worth complaining about but still worth noting although I would definitely order it again.  The burgers were both amazing.  We asked for them to be cooked medium and this kitchen really knows what that means.  My 9 year old that ordered the Industrial Burger, which is made with dry aged brisket, said he thought his was cooked rare. I explained that it was a true medium and most of the time that he requests a medium burger he receives it somewhere between medium and medium well.  These were done properly.  The Industrial is fantastic.  The brisket is rich and happily fatty and flavorful and is topped with a proper cheddar cheese, \"tavern sauce\" and more of that wonderful onion jam that came with the pretzel.  A masterpiece of a burger.  The Colonial Burger is also great but walks a step behind the Industrial.  It is made with grass fed beef and it shows.  The thick cut bacon is amazing and plentiful as is the cheddar cheese and they made a great choice in topping this burger with a malt mayo.  My wife chose the Cauliflower Panini, mostly based on the fact that it's topped with ricotta salata.  I took a bit or two or three and I really enjoyed it.

I ordered the sausage bar pizza, the turkey reuben, the dessert pie and the kitchen sink dessert bar.  The reuben is great, I have had it before. They use real turkey and the dressing is delicious. The pizza could have been delicious but It had some type of very spicy pickled peppers or something on it that made it way to spicy to eat. I tried taking them off and it was still too spicy to eat and I like spicy.  I should have looked on the menu to see the ingredients but the take out girl said she could help me order so I didn't. She did mention the sausage on it but not the pickled spicy peppers or whatever it was that made it so incredibly spicy. I had to throw it out. The gentleman suggested the dessert pie and dessert kitchen sink when I got there. The dessert kitchen sink was dried out and not flavorful except for a strong coffee flavor, I expected more since there was so much in it. The pie was a cute idea but it was just ok in taste. \n",

I tried to salvage what I could but ultimately the dish left a horrible burnt after taste in my mouth that I decided not to finish it.

She bitched slightly about the Bass being \"downstairs,\" so being the understanding person I am, I went with a $5 pitcher of Miller Lite and asked for a food menu.  She told us to order a tab she had to hold on to a card, so we gave her a card and waited another 10 minutes for her to come back.  She opened the tab and my boyfriend asked again for a food menu.  Another 10 minutes, as she ran past me, I yelled for another food menu.  This is the first time she smiled or showed any kind of hospitality-appropriate attitude.  She took our order.  Food came.  Another 25 minutes or so for her to come back to us.  With plates piled up in front of us, we asked for boxes and the check.  She brought back some boxes and then another 20 minutes later, she finally closed the check.  Awful service.  Simply awful.

The lamb stew, made with lots of veggies and herbs was also a treat. The brussel sprouts with butternut squash in butter along with the dreamiest whipped potatoes  (pommes puree) were amazing. Their complimentary assortment of breads and artisan butter were great. During the meal they bring you this strange pastry called a \"pop over\". Buttery chewy crunchy goodness. Almost too full for dessert but the peanut butter mousse along with the complimentary tasting plate from the pastry chef were amazing. The wait staff was extremely educated on the food and wine as well as very friendly and efficient.

People rave about it and they accommodate a family member with a gluten allergy who really enjoys their food. We've been there at least 10 times and I've never had anything good. Never. Maybe their ice cream is good? I tried their complicated stuff and was disappointed and tried keeping it simple to the same result. Generally, utterly flavorless. NaCl people. Use it. Drown this food in ketchup. Try something, anything. I could close my eyes and never know what I was eating. Bacon, pancake, fries, burger, chicken. Eyes shut, all the same taste. Best pancakes? For filling a pothole? As a manhole cover? They have the same texture as wet drywall-no exaggeration.  I had them twice and they were the same each time-I was hoping it was a horrible mistake. 3 pancakes weighed easily a pound and a half. No discernible bubbles inside at all. A travesty.  The syrup is brown sugar water and equally tasteless. Whatever gives the award for \"Best Pancakes\" to a place that cannot understand that maple syrup is what is served on pancakes should have their award giving status revoked.  If it was even supposed to have artificial maple flavor it did not. I had a bacon cheeseburger. I separated it into it's components. The bacon and the beef, tasted separately had essentially the same flavor and varied only in texture. Both kind of tasted like the bun except that was softer. How do you get bacon that is not salty enough? It usually competes with pork for the main ingredient. Fries came either limp or overdone. I tried their version of a fat sandwich and it was the same deal. Five or 6 ingredients and it may as well have had one since they all tasted like nothing. I added salt to everything it was appropriate to and it upgraded it from \"lump\" to \"food\". Best I could do. I consider ketchup to be something you drown food in if you are in a hurry and just need to get calories down, and that's what I did here. The pancakes are inedible. I brought them home for later to see if my kids want them, but I'll bet they look at me like I'm a madman and drop them in the trash-even with actual maple syrup.\n",

Their pancakes are gigantic and have great varieties.  All their egg platters are egg-cellent as well (sorry I couldn't resist).

There were the requisite CheezWhiz &amp; yummy fried mushrooms &amp; caramelized onions. The sandwich didn't quite work though; the pretzel bun is a neat idea, but it's too tough to bite into &amp; overly salty. I used my knife &amp; fork but it was difficult to cut the tough pretzel.

MC got the Black &amp; Tan (real vanilla-bean ice cream with butterscotch &amp; hot fudge toppings); I got a scoop of strawberry ice cream with wet walnuts &amp; whipped cream &amp; a cherry. Oh. My.
